\title{run_cutoff: Determine Enrichment Score Cutoffs}
\usage{
run_cutoff(es_out, start = 0.01, end = 0.6)
}
\arguments{
\item{es_out}{A data frame of enrichment scores (cells x gene sets) generated from \code{run_gsea}.}

\item{start}{Numeric, indicating the starting proportion of enrichment scores to consider when defining cutoffs.}

\item{end}{Numeric, indicating the ending proportion of enrichment scores to consider when defining cutoffs.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing calculated cutoff values for each gene set. Each cutoff is identified based on
        score trends, highlighting the point where the score derivative changes significantly.
}
\description{
Calculates optimal cutoff values within enrichment scores to define significant cells based on
changes in enrichment score trends. This helps identify cells with prominent gene set activity.
}
\examples{
# Example enrichment scores
es_out <- data.frame(GeneSet1 = runif(10), GeneSet2 = runif(10))
run_cutoff(es_out, start = 0.01, end = 0.6)
