\title{run_gsea: Single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA)}
\usage{
run_gsea(datExpr, gs)
}
\arguments{
\item{datExpr}{A matrix of expression data (genes x cells) to analyze.}

\item{gs}{A list containing gene sets, where each element is a vector of gene names representing a single gene set.}
}
\value{
A data frame with enrichment scores (cells x gene sets), where each cell's enrichment score
        corresponds to the activity of each gene set in that cell.
}
\description{
This function performs ssGSEA to calculate enrichment scores for specified gene sets in single-cell RNA-seq data.
The method is particularly useful for identifying gene set activity within individual cells.
}
\examples{
# Example data and gene sets
datExpr <- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow=100, ncol=10)
gs <- list(GeneSet1 = c("GeneA", "GeneB", "GeneC"), GeneSet2 = c("GeneD", "GeneE"))
run_gsea(datExpr, gs)
